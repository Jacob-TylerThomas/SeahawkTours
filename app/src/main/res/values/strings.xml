    <string name="CIS_text">
        The Computer Information Systems (CIS) building was constructed to house the Information Systems and Operations Management Department from the Cameron School of Business and the Department of Computer Science from the College of Arts and Sciences. \n
        The CIS Building, a new 51,731 square-foot state-of-the-art facility on the UNCW campus, opened January 10, 2007 for the new school semester.
        Work on the facility began on July 29, 2004 with the groundbreaking, and competed in December of 2006.
        The building cost approximately $12.8 million and was funded by the North Carolina State Bond campaign of 2000. \n
        \n
        Housed within the new building is the Financial Markets Room and, thanks to a donation from Edward Jones and over 50 if its financial advisers, the Edward Jones Financial Lab.
        Both rooms contain a stock board and ticker, however the Edward Jones Financial Lab also includes the Bloomberg Trading Terminal.
        With this terminal, students and faculty have the ability to trade stocks directly with the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and more. \n
        \n
        The Department of Computer Science and the Department of Information Systems and Operations Management are housed at CIS together and are jointly offering a Master of Science in Computer Science Information Systems (MSCSIS) degree, an intensive graduate program aimed at preparing the student to assume leadership roles in the development and implementation of computer and information systems.

        Bear Hall opened at its present site in 1972 as the home for the Business and Economics Departments.
        Currently, the Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics, and Philosophy and Religion occupy classrooms, teaching labs and faculty offices.
        The College of Arts and Science also resides here. \n

        As the inscription on the plaque states Bear Hall is named for, "The original Isaac Bear Building, located at Market and 13th Streets, served as the first home of Wilmington College, outside the public school system.Classes were first held there in 1947." Constructed in 1912, the name of the first building was given by Samuel Bear, Jr. (1854-1916) as a memorial to his brother, Isaac Bear.
        The Bear family, owners of an intrastate wholesale dry goods firm located on Front Street, made a number of large donations to better the community such as a wing to James Walker Memorial Hospital.
        Isaac Bear was known as "one of Wilmington\'s most capable and highly esteemed businessmen."
        He was a member of North State Lodge of B\'Nai Brith, past Grand President of District Grand Lodge, and B.P.O.E Elks #532.
        Upon his death, the Isaac Bear Memorial School served to remember "the close friendship and devotion between the brothers and their interest in public welfare."
        The Order of the Isaac Bear is an honorary organization composed of faculty members that taught at the site of the original Wilmington College.
        Once the college built the new campus off of College Road, the Isaac Bear Building was torn down (1961).\n

    <string name="Dobo_text">
        Opened for use in 1996, the New Science Building contained classrooms, laboratories and faculty offices for the Chemistry and Biology Departments.
        Known as Dobo Hall since its 1999 dedication to the Dobo brothers, it is currently used by the Department of Biology and Marine Biology and the Department of Chemistry. \n
        \n
        As both native sons and alumni of Wilmington College the brothers Dobo made their mark on the local community.
        Gabriel William (Bill), a World War II veteran came to the newly opened college in 1948 and wrote a column for the "Seahawk" newspaper. Robert (Bob) Ridgely, also a veteran on World War II, attended Wilmington College in 1950.
        After completing their studies, the brothers established two private water companies - Cape Fear Utilities and Quality Water Supplies, which contributed to the growth of New Hanover County.
        Their businesses were sold to the City of Wilmington in 1999.
        As philanthropists, their generosity has sustained UNCW and other educational and humanitarian institutions throughout the state.
        The building\'s plaque inscription reflects their benevolent dedication, "The future of southeastern North Carolina is brighter as a result of their commitment to their hometown, Wilmington College and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington."
        Bob Dobo passed away April 28, 2009.
